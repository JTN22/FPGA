# 🔌 FPGA Projects

This repository contains basic digital design projects implemented using **Verilog** and tested on the **Intel DE10-Lite FPGA development board**. The code and testbenches were written during an introductory internship focused on hardware logic design and simulation.

These beginner-level exercises helped build foundational skills in:
- Hardware Description Language (HDL)
- Simulation with waveform viewers
- Module creation and testing using testbenches
- Logic design using FPGA toolchains

> 🧑‍💻 Note: These labs were completed early in my undergraduate studies, during an exploratory internship alongside peers from various majors.

## 🗂️ Project Folders

### `Lab0_FullAdder1bit`
- 📄 Implements a **1-bit full adder** using Verilog.
- 🧪 Includes testbench and waveform output to verify correct binary addition.
- 🖼️ Visuals: Logic diagram (`FullAdder1Bit.png`) and simulation waveform (`FullAdder1Bit_wave.png`).

### `Lab0_SwLed`
- 🔁 Connects **switch inputs to LED outputs**, a basic hardware I/O test.
- ✅ Useful for understanding pin assignments and signal behavior on the FPGA.

### `ex02_alu`
- ⚙️ Simulates a simple **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** with operations like addition, subtraction, etc.
- 🔍 Includes simulation waveforms and Verilog modules (`alu.v`, `alu_tb.v`, `alu_top.v`).
- 🖼️ Diagrams and results show how different inputs produce different ALU operations.
