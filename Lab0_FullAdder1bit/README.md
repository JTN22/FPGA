# âž• 1-Bit Full Adder

This project implements a **1-bit full adder** in Verilog. A full adder performs binary addition of three input bits (A, B, and Carry-in) and produces a Sum and a Carry-out.

## Files
- `FullAdder1Bit.v`: Verilog code for the full adder logic
- `FullAdder1Bit_tb.v`: Testbench to verify correct behavior
- `FullAdder1Bit_wave.png`: Simulation waveform showing expected results
- `FullAdder1Bit.png`: Diagram of the logic gate implementation

## Purpose
This was an introductory exercise in digital logic design and testbench simulation.
