# ðŸ’¡ Switch-to-LED Control

This simple Verilog project connects FPGA board **switch inputs** to **LED outputs**. When a switch is flipped, the corresponding LED lights up.

- `SwLed.v`: Verilog code linking switch inputs to LED outputs
- `SwLed.png`: Diagram of the circuit

## Purpose
Used to test hardware pin mapping and basic signal flow between FPGA inputs and outputs.
